                <p>We got to meet Mr.Samson Kapeyi from the refactory who took us through a series of topics in the first week.Day one we got introduced to software development and we got to learn how the internet works and the protocols it follows to produce processed data, He proceeded onto telling us about the IP (internet protocal) in which every device on the internet has a unique address called an Ip address that allow computers to find and communicate with each other,Pcket switching that showed that data sent to the internet breaks into smaller packets with each having and IP address of a specific device .These packets are sent to a nearby router which forwards them to the other until the reach the destination and with protocals the computers get to understand and communicate with each other as well as understand data being sent .Servers store the data and serves it for the clients.  </p>
